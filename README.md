Hierarchia: A hierarchical note taking application for Android 4.1.2 

Features:
- Organize notes in a hierarchical structure by using expandable and collapsible panels.
- Each notebook is saved as an XML file, which can be displayed in customized formats by using XSLT.
- Multiple notebooks can be opened, one for each tab.
- Provide addition, modification, removal, re-organization and searching functions for entries in a notebook.
- Support the rendering of mathematical formulae via MathJax.

Installation and demonstration:
1. Copy Hierarchia.apk to your Android device and install.
2. Copy default.xsl and demo.xml to a directory of the device.
3. In the application, click Notebook > Open notebook, select demo.xml in the directory.

Note:
- Only tested on Android 4.1.2.
- It may take much time to render the mathematical formlae in a large notebook file.
- You may also write the notes on a desktop computer: download the source codes, in www/js/index.js, set desktop = true, then open www/index.html with FireFox. Note that you must manually copy out the contents before closing the browser, otherwise all your works will be lost!
- The application is built by using PhoneGap version 5.1.1.
- If the application does not satisfy your needs, feel free to download and modify the source codes.

Regards,
Gary.
